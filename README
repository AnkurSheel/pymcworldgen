Chrisknyfe's pyMCWorldGen 
Alpha 2
========

This package is a pipelined minecraft world generator written in Python. This is a pre-release to help stir up discussion with other modders who have made terrain generators before or are currently developing terrain generation mods.

What's new in Alpha 2:
========
- LandmarkGenerator class, for placing a large number of landmarks easily.
- Beginning of the unit testing code, which means more bugs will get caught, sooner. You can run them yourself with 'runtests.py'

Installation:
========

This mod depends on:
    Python 2.6: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.6/ 
    numpy: http://numpy.scipy.org/
    pymclevel: https://github.com/codewarrior0/pymclevel
    pylab/scipy: http://www.scipy.org/PyLab (for saving graphs of heightmap data)
    c10t: http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=33803 (for taking a quick snapshot of the world)

    you can download these dependencies manually, or use the script 'get-dependencies.sh' if you're a linux user (who uses aptitude.)

Usage:
========
    Standalone Map Generation:
    python mcworldgen.py

    Test map will be saved to ./renders

    It just generates a random 16 x 16 map as 'testmap' and creates a c10t rendering of the map (given that c10t exists.)
